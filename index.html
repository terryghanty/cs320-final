        <p>Project Summary:</p>
        <p>There are a few important things we as US citizens know less about than we should: think insurance and taxes.  This project is about tackling one of these black boxes from a perspective you might not have known existed.  For-profit medical companies pay millions each year to teaching hospital and physicians on top of what they are paid for their typical services.  To tackle this problem we analyze millions of data-cells across four years of data.  The goal is to answer the question: can you trust your physician?
