        <p>Description of Data File:</p>
        <p>We used four partial data files from OpenPaymentsData.CMS.gov for years 2015-2018.  There was a file for each year analyzed.  Each of these years had a total of about 10M records each with 75 columns of data so we think that comparing across years is a good representation.  The data covers open payments made from corporate companies in the medical field.  Each row corresponds to a payment made and the columns describe details of that payment</p>
